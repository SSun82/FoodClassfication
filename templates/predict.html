					Step 1
						For the chilli paste, soak the dried red chillies in hot water for 15 minutes or until softened. Then use tongs to remove them from the soaking liquid. Reserve the soaking liquid in case you need it when blending. Roughly chop the chillies and place them in the bowl of a food processor. Add the fresh chillies, shallots and salt. Blend until smooth (add a tablespoon of the chilli soaking liquid if your food processor gets stuck).
					</li>
					<li>
					Step 2
						Heat 4 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the chilli paste and cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes. Transfer the chilli paste to a jar.
					</li>
					<li>
					Step 3
						For the stir-fry sauce, mix the ingredients in a small bowl and set aside for later.
					</li>
					<li>
					Step 4
						Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a wok or large frying pan over high heat. Add the garlic and stir-fry for 5 seconds. Then add the Chinese sausage and stir-fry for another 10 seconds. Then add the fishcakes and the prawns. Stir-fry until the prawns are almost cooked. Then add 2 heaped tablespoons (or to taste) of the chilli paste. Toss to combine. Then push the ingredients out to the side of the pan to make room in the middle. Add a tablespoon of oil to the centre of the pan. Then pour in the eggs. Use your spatula to spread the eggs out. Once the eggs are set, toss them around with the remaining ingredients.
					</li>
					<li>
					Step 5
						Now add the noodles and the stir-fry sauce. Stir-fry until well combined. Then toss through the bean shoots and the Chinese chives. Remove from heat and serve.
					</li>
					<li>
					Notes:
						– You’ll have more chilli paste than you need for this recipe. Simply store it in the fridge for up to a month. Use it to add a chilli kick to just about anything…stir-fries, grilled meats or breakfast eggs.
						– Chinese sausage, also known as lap cheong is a sweet preserved pork sausage. It can be bought online or from an Asian grocery store.
						– Asian fishcakes are available in the fridge or freezer section of any Asian grocery store.

					Step 1
						To cook the rice, add the rice, coconut milk and lemongrass into a saucepan. Settle the rice evenly into the bottom of the saucepan. Place your finger on top of the rice and add enough water so that the liquid comes up to your first knuckle. Place over a medium-high heat and simmer for 10 minutes or until most of the liquid has evaporated. Then place a lid on and reduce the heat to low and cook for another 2 minutes. Then turn the heat off and allow to sit, covered, for 10 minutes. 
					</li>
					<li>
					Step 2
						For the spicy ikan bilis sambal, soak the dried chillies in hot water for 15 minutes to soften. Drain the chillies squeezing out the excess liquid. Reserve the soaking liquid. 
					</li>
					<li>
					Step 3
						Place the soaked chillies in the bowl of a small food processor along with the fresh chilli, shallot, garlic and shrimp paste. Process until a coarse paste forms.  
					</li>
					<li>
					Step 4
						Heat the oil in a wok over high heat. Add the anchovies and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes or until crisp. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a plate lined with paper towel. Add the onion to the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Transfer to the plate with the anchovies. Add the chilli mixture to the wok. Reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring often for 5 minutes or until the red oil rises to the surface. Add the sugar, tamarind and 2 tablespoons of the chilli soaking liquid. Simmer for 5 minutes or until reduced. Stir in the anchovies and onion. Transfer to a bowl.  
					</li>
					<li>
					Step 5
						When ready to serve, use a fork to fluff up the coconut rice. Serve the rice with the spicy ikan bilis sambal, peanuts, egg, cucumber and ayam goreng (if using). 
					</li>
					<li>
					Notes:
						– Typically, this rice is infused with pandan leaves, but I use lemongrass or ginger slices when I can’t find pandan leaves at my Asian grocery store. You could also just do coconut milk without the extra aromatics. 
						– Ikan bilis are a dried anchovy fish that are sold through Asian grocery stores. They can be sold ‘fresh’ frozen (in which case you need to cook them as I have here) or they can be bought shelf-stable and already fried, in which case you can just add them into the sambal without having to fry them first.
